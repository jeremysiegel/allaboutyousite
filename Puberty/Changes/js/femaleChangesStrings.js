Breasts can take a few years to develop completely, and it is normal for breasts to change throughout puberty. It is also normal for each breast to be a different size.',
      genitals: 'The vulva, or the outside part of the genitals (sometimes what gets called the vagina) gets bigger. The vagina also produces fluid to clean itself. Periods, or the menstrual cycle also start.',
      hair: 'More hair starts to grow all around the body, like the arms and legs. New hair shows up especially around the genitals which is called pubic hair, and in the armpits.',
      growth: 'There is a "growth spurt", or a time when you get taller pretty quickly. You might notice that you need to get new clothes.',
      hips: 'Females develop wider hips, which helps when giving birth to a baby.',
