      1: "First month:\n\nYou are only the size of a grain of rice, but already you are starting to take shape.\n\nIs that a tail? Don't worry, it will go away.",
      2: 'Second month:\n\nHere come your eyes, mouth, and ears. During pregnancy your food is going to come from a special organ called the placenta. It connects you to your mother through the umbilical cord (which goes into your belly button!)',
      3: 'Third month:\n\nYou are starting to explore by moving your fingers. Moving in the womb is important to develop the muscles you will use the rest of your life.',
      4: "Fourth month:\n\nLooks like you're not alone! You live in a fluid, which keeps you from bouncing around too much. Sometimes twins have to share a liquid sac, and sometimes they each get their own.",
      5: "Fifth month:\n\nYawn! Growing is tiring work, and you will spend a lot of time in the womb sleeping.\n\nYou are now the size of a sweet potato.",
      6: "Sixth month:\n\nYour heart started beating all the way back in the second month, but now it is really cooking. It beats about twice as fast now as it will after you are born.",
      7: 'Seventh month:\n\nBet mom felt that kick! You are moving around a lot. You can also hear what is going on outside and respond to sound and light.',
      8: 'Eighth month:\n\nThe lungs are the last part of you to develop. Your oxygen actually comes in through the umbilical cord, but you practice by breathing in the fluid you live in.',
      9: "Ninth month:\n\nYou are all grown and ready to be born! You'll flip upside down to be born head first.\n\nOnce you are ready there's no stopping you!"
